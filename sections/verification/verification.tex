This section evaluates the safety and robustness of the learned neural network controller, discussing the implementation and analysis of three complementary verification methods: (i) formal controller-level verification in isolation, (ii) system-level reachability analysis of the closed-loop dynamics, and (iii) empirical robustness analysis of the neural network under bounded input perturbations.

Together, these methods provide insight into which safety-relevant properties can be formally guaranteed, which can only be assessed empirically, and where current verification tools encounter scalability limitations. 

% Training techniques such as adversarial training and property-driven training, introduced in the previous section, are evaluated here in terms of their impact on verifiability and robustness, rather than being treated as verification methods themselves.
