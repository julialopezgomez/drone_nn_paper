	abstract = {We investigate a method for formally verifying the absence of adversarial examples in a neural network controller. Our approach applies to networks with piecewise affine activation units, which may be encoded symbolically as a piecewise affine mapping from inputs to outputs. The approach rests on characterizing and bounding a critical subset of the state space where controller action is required, partitioning this critical subset, and using satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) to prove nonexistence of safety counterexamples on each of the resulting partition elements. We demonstrate this approach on a simple collision avoidance neural network controller, trained with reinforcement learning to avoid collisions in a simplified simulated environment. After encoding the network weights in SMT, we formally verify safety of the neural network controller on a subset of the critical partition elements, and determine that the rest of the critical set partition elements are potentially unsafe. We further experimentally confirm the existence of actual adversarial collision scenarios in 90\% of the identified potentially unsafe critical partition elements, indicating that our approach is reasonably tight.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of formally verifying the safety of an autonomous robot equipped with a Neural Network (NN) controller that processes LiDAR images to produce control actions. Given a workspace that is characterized by a set of polytopic obstacles, our objective is to compute the set of safe initial states such that a robot trajectory starting from these initial states is guaranteed to avoid the obstacles. Our approach is to construct a finite state abstraction of the system and use standard reachability analysis over the finite state abstraction to compute the set of safe initial states. To mathematically model the imaging function, that maps the robot position to the LiDAR image, we introduce the notion of imaging-adapted partitions of the workspace in which the imaging function is guaranteed to be affine. Given this workspace partitioning, a discrete-time linear dynamics of the robot, and a pre-trained NN controller with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) non-linearity, we utilize a Satisfiability Modulo Convex (SMC) encoding to enumerate all the possible assignments of different ReLUs. To accelerate this process, we develop a pre-processing algorithm that could rapidly prune the space of feasible ReLU assignments. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms using numerical simulations with the increasing complexity of the neural network controller.},

	abstract = {As machine learning is increasingly deployed in autonomous systems, verification of neural network controllers is becoming an active research domain. Existing tools and annual verification competitions suggest that soon this technology will become effective for real-world applications. Our application comes from the emerging field of microflyers that are passively transported by the wind, which may have various uses in weather or pollution monitoring. Specifically, we investigate centimetre-scale bio-inspired gliding drones that resemble Alsomitra macrocarpa diaspores. In this paper, we propose a new case study on verifying Alsomitra-inspired drones with neural network controllers, with the aim of adhering closely to a target trajectory. We show that our system differs substantially from existing VNN and ARCH competition benchmarks, and show that a combination of tools holds promise for verifying such systems in the future, if certain shortcomings can be overcome. We propose a novel method for robust training of regression networks, and investigate formalisations of this case study in Vehicle and CORA. Our verification results suggest that the investigated training methods do improve performance and robustness of neural network controllers in this application, but are limited in scope and usefulness. This is due to systematic limitations of both Vehicle and CORA, and the complexity of our system reducing the scale of reachability, which we investigate in detail. If these limitations can be overcome, it will enable engineers to develop safe and robust technologies that improve people's lives and reduce our impact on the environment.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Military missions are often limited by the quantity of supplies that soldiers can carry with them. The purpose of this research was to develop an autonomous aerial cargo delivery device capable of resupplying soldiers in contested and remote locations. Specifically focusing on the final leg of delivery, this device aims to transport cargo from existing long-range Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) to soldiers on the ground in a controlled and safe manner.The solution developed through this research included low altitude drops of small, palletized, parachute-suspended loads from assorted UAS in flight. The device developed to accomplish this would be responsible for safely holding a variety of cargo, releasing from the UAS, decelerating in flight on its descent, and absorbing shocks on impact with the ground. By receiving signals from the UAS, this device would operate autonomously as no human interaction is required for its operation. Engineering analysis was conducted on these areas and an initial prototype was constructed based on relevant findings. Although intended for use with multiple UAS platforms, the Squad Operations Advanced Resupply (SOAR) UAS, currently in development at the US Army DEVCOM Soldier Center, was selected specifically as the basis for prototype modeling and design.Through pilot testing, evaluation, and analysis it was determined that this method of inserting supplies into remote and contested environments is a viable and novel solution to small unit resupply. The device’s reliability was confirmed in its operation and data showed that the device increased survivability of cargo. This method of airdrop has great potential for future military and humanitarian applications and is worthy of further development.},

The systems are designed to interact with the physical world, monitor and control the physical processes while in operation, and generate data. Deep Neural Networks (DNN) comprise multiple layers of interconnected neurons that process input data to produce predictions. Spatial-temporal data represents the physical world and its evolution over time and space. The generated spatial-temporal data is used to make decisions and control the behavior of CPS. This paper systematically reviews the applications of DNNs, namely convolutional, recurrent, and graphs, in handling spatial-temporal data in CPS. An extensive literature survey is conducted to determine the areas in which DNNs have successfully captured spatial-temporal data in CPS and the emerging areas that require attention. The research proposes a three-dimensional framework that considers: CPS (transportation, manufacturing, and others), Target (spatial-temporal data processing, anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, resource allocation, real-time decisions, and multi-modal data fusion), and DNN schemes (CNNs, RNNs, and GNNs). Finally, research areas that need further investigation are identified, such as performance and security. Addressing data quality, strict performance assurance, reliability, safety, and security resilience challenges are the areas that are required for further research.},

This strategy allows: (i) to avoid the two-subsystems control paradigm generally adopted by conventional UAV controllers; (ii) all control inputs to be defined at once; and (iii) to lump all unknown dynamics from both translational and rotational levels into a single vector term. The weights of the NN are determined online by an adaptive law based on the Lyapunov synthesis method. The tracking and adaptation errors are shown to be uniformly ultimately bounded. Simulation and experimental results, including comparison data, are provided to validate and assess the proposed control solution.},

This letter presents the modelling, performance analysis, design, and a proposed controller for a novel ACTS with variable cable lengths, named Variable Aerial Cable Towed System (VACTS). Winches are embedded on the UAVs for actuating the cable lengths similar to a Cable-Driven Parallel Robot to increase the versatility of the ACTS.

The design is based on a wrench analysis of the VACTS, without constraining the cables to pass through the UAV center of mass, as in current works. Additionally, the performance of the VACTS and ACTS are compared showing that the added versatility comes at the cost of payload and configuration flexibility.

	abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

We broadly refer to this category as AI and NNCS (AINNCS). The friendly competition took place as part of the workshop Applied Verification for Continuous and Hybrid Systems (ARCH) in 2023. In the fifth edition of this AINNCS category at ARCH-COMP, three tools have been applied to solve ten different benchmark problems, which are CORA, JuliaReach and NNV. In reusing the benchmarks from the last iteration, we demonstrate the continuous progress in developing these tools: Two out of three tools can verify more instances than in the 2022 iteration. A novelty of this year's iteration is the shared computation hardware that allows for a fairer comparison among the participants.},

	abstract = {Background Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS or drones) could potentially be used for the routine transport of small goods such as diagnostic clinical laboratory specimens. To the best of our knowledge, there is no published study of the impact of UAS transportation on laboratory tests. Methods Three paired samples were obtained from each one of 56 adult volunteers in a single phlebotomy event (336 samples total): two tubes each for chemistry, hematology, and coagulation testing respectively. 168 samples were driven to the flight field and held stationary. The other 168 samples were flown in the UAS for a range of times, from 6 to 38 minutes. After the flight, 33 of the most common chemistry, hematology, and coagulation tests were performed. Statistical methods as well as performance criteria from four distinct clinical, academic, and regulatory bodies were used to evaluate the results. Results Results from flown and stationary sample pairs were similar for all 33 analytes. Bias and intercepts were {\textless}10\% and {\textless}13\% respectively for all analytes. Bland-Altman comparisons showed a mean difference of 3.2\% for Glucose and {\textless}1\% for other analytes. Only bicarbonate did not meet the strictest (Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia Quality Assurance Program) performance criteria. This was due to poor precision rather than bias. There were no systematic differences between laboratory-derived (analytic) CV’s and the CV’s of our flown versus terrestrial sample pairs however CV’s from the sample pairs tended to be slightly higher than analytic CV’s. The overall concordance, based on clinical stratification (normal versus abnormal), was 97\%. Length of flight had no impact on the results. Conclusions Transportation of laboratory specimens via small UASs does not affect the accuracy of routine chemistry, hematology, and coagulation tests results from selfsame samples. However it results in slightly poorer precision for some analytes.},

	abstract = {Background
Immunization programs in low and middle income countries (LMICs) face numerous challenges in getting life-saving vaccines to the people who need them. As unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology has progressed in recent years, potential use cases for UAVs have proliferated due to their ability to traverse difficult terrains, reduce labor, and replace fleets of vehicles that require costly maintenance.
Methods
Using a HERMES-generated simulation model, we performed sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of using an unmanned aerial system (UAS) for routine vaccine distribution under a range of circumstances reflecting variations in geography, population, road conditions, and vaccine schedules. We also identified the UAV payload and UAS costs necessary for a UAS to be favorable over a traditional multi-tiered land transport system (TMLTS).
Results
Implementing the UAS in the baseline scenario improved vaccine availability (96\% versus 94\%) and produced logistics cost savings of \$0.08 per dose administered as compared to the TMLTS. The UAS maintained cost savings in all sensitivity analyses, ranging from \$0.05 to \$0.21 per dose administered. The minimum UAV payloads necessary to achieve cost savings over the TMLTS, for the various vaccine schedules and UAS costs and lifetimes tested, were substantially smaller (up to 0.40L) than the currently assumed UAV payload of 1.5L. Similarly, the maximum UAS costs that could achieve savings over the TMLTS were greater than the currently assumed costs under realistic flight conditions.
Conclusion
Implementing a UAS could increase vaccine availability and decrease costs in a wide range of settings and circumstances if the drones are used frequently enough to overcome the capital costs of installing and maintaining the system. Our computational model showed that major drivers of costs savings from using UAS are road speed of traditional land vehicles, the number of people needing to be vaccinated, and the distance that needs to be traveled.},

	abstract = {Objectives
In mid-2020, the Ghana Health Service introduced Zipline’s aerial logistics (centralized storage and delivery by drones) in the Western North Region to enhance health supply chain resilience. This intervention led to improved vaccination coverage in high-utilization districts. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of aerial logistics as an intervention to improve immunization coverage.
Methods
An attack rate model, adjusted for vaccination coverage and vaccine efficacy, was used to estimate disease incidence among vaccinated and unvaccinated populations, focusing on 17 022 infants. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of US dollar per averted disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) were evaluated from societal and government perspectives, using real-world operations data. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed using Monte Carlo simulations.
Results
In 2021, aerial logistics averted 688 disease cases. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were \$41 and \$58 per averted DALY from the societal and government perspectives, respectively. The intervention was cost-saving when at least 20\% of vaccines delivered by aerial logistics replaced those that would have been delivered by ground transportation, with potential government savings of up to \$250 per averted DALY. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of these findings.
Conclusions
Under conservative assumptions, aerial logistics was a highly cost-effective intervention to increase immunization coverage. The intervention was cost-saving even with low levels of replacement of traditional last mile delivery. These findings support expanding aerial logistics within the national immunization program and have significant implications for other low- and middle-income countries seeking cost-effective health supply chain solutions.},

The model is illustrated in a case study for distributing routine childhood vaccines in Vanuatu, a South Pacific island nation with limited transportation infrastructure. Our research incorporates multiple drone types, recharging of drones, a cold chain travel time limit, transshipment delays for switching transport modes, and practical limits on the vaccine paths and drone trips. The goal is to locate facilities (distribution centers, drone bases, and relay stations) and design vaccine paths to minimize transportation costs, including the fixed costs for facilities and transportation links and variable costs for transportation through the network. Results show large potential cost savings and improved service quality provided by incorporating drones in a multimodal vaccine distribution system. Results also show the impact of introducing drones on the usage of other more expensive or slower transport modes.},

In this paper we tackle the problem of autonomous last mile delivery in urban environments using an off-the-shelf drone. We build a prototype system that is able to fly to the approximate delivery location using GPS and then find the exact drop-off location using visual navigation. The drop-off location could, e.g., be on a balcony or porch, and simply needs to be indicated by a visual marker on the wall or window. We test our system components in simulated environments, including the visual navigation and collision avoidance. Finally, we deploy our drone in a real-world environment and show how it can find the drop-off point on a balcony. To stimulate future research in this topic we open source our code.},

	doi = {10.1016/S2214-109X(22)00048-1},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The accessibility of blood and blood products remains challenging in many countries because of the complex supply chain of short lifetime products, timely access, and demand fluctuation at the hospital level. In an effort to improve availability and delivery times, Rwanda launched the use of drones to deliver blood products to remote health facilities. We evaluated the effect of this intervention on blood product delivery times and wastage.
METHODS: We studied data from 20 health facilities between Jan 1, 2015, and Dec 31, 2019, in Rwanda. First, we did a cross-sectional comparison of data on emergency delivery times from the drone operator collected between March 17, 2017, and Dec 31, 2019, with two sources of estimated driving times (Regional Centre for Blood Transfusion estimates and Google Maps). Second, we used interrupted time series analysis and monthly administrative data to assess changes in blood product expirations after the commencement of drone deliveries.
FINDINGS: Between March 17, 2017, and Dec 31, 2019, 12 733 blood product orders were delivered by drones. 5517 (43\%) of 12 733 were emergency orders. The mean drone delivery time was 49·6 min (95\% CI 49·1 to 50·2), which was 79 min faster than existing road delivery methods based on estimated driving times (p{\textless}0·0001) and 98 min faster based on Google Maps estimates (p{\textless}0·0001). The decrease in mean delivery time ranged from 3 min to 211 min depending on the distance to the facility and road quality. We also found a decrease of 7·1 blood unit expirations per month after the start of drone delivery (95\% CI -11·8 to -2·4), which translated to a 67\% reduction at 12 months.
INTERPRETATION: We found that drone delivery led to faster delivery times and less blood component wastage in health facilities. Future studies should investigate if these improvements are cost-effective, and whether drone delivery might be effective for other pharmaceutical and health supplies that cannot be easily stored at remote facilities.

Until now, proof-of-concept studies have demonstrated successful attitude control in simulation. However, detailed experimental investigations have not yet been conducted. This study applied deep reinforcement learning for one-degree-of-freedom pitch control in wind tunnel tests with the aim of gaining practical understandings of attitude control application. Three controllers with different discrete action choices, that is, elevator angles, were designed. The controllers with larger action rates exhibited better performance in terms of following angle-of-attack commands. The root mean square errors for tracking angle-of-attack commands decreased from 3.42° to 1.99° as the maximum action rate increased from 10°/s to 50°/s. The comparison between experimental and simulation results showed that the controller with a smaller action rate experienced the friction effect, and the controllers with larger action rates experienced fluctuating behaviors in elevator maneuvers owing to delay. The investigation of the effect of friction and delay on pitch control highlighted the importance of conducting experiments to understand actual control performances, specifically when the controllers were trained with a low-fidelity model.},

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) has seen an uptick in research interest in recent years, with many papers published in a plethora of different fields, topics and applications. A lot of that can be attributed to the recent advancements in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) as a whole, the power of deep neural networks and the incorporation of them into reinforcement learning algorithms and techniques. This marriage of deep neural networks and traditional reinforcement learning methods has enabled reinforcement learning algorithms to achieve incredible results in use-cases that were previously deemed to be too complex. One of these highly complex scenarios is the realm of flight. In the last few years the number of papers published in this field has increased dramatically, but there is a fairly big divide between two major categories (quadcopters vs. fixed-wing aircraft). There is published work focusing on reinforcement learning using quadcopters, also known as drones, and there is published work focusing on fixed-wing aircraft, the more traditional aircraft, commonly referred to as airplanes. This paper focuses on the latter and will give an overview over the current state of reinforcement learning in the field of fixed-wing aviation. It will look into available toolkits usable for research as well as give an overview of different fields and tasks within reinforcement learning for fixed-wing aircraft control tasks. It contributes by providing detailed information about the methodologies used in each paper, while pointing out each paper’s contributions as well. A total of 48 papers on fixed-wing RL and airplane control are discussed. With the main focus lying on papers published post 2015, after the publication of Mnih et al.’s impactful deep RL paper.},

It is based on using a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with a regressor to output the drone steering commands. Furthermore, multiple auxiliary navigation paths that form a ‘navigation envelope’ are used for data augmentation to make the system adaptable to real-life deployment scenarios. The approach is suitable for automating drone navigation in applications that exhibit regular trips or visits to same locations such as environmental and desertification monitoring, parcel/aid delivery and drone-based wireless internet delivery. In this case, the proposed algorithm replaces human operators, enhances accuracy of GPS-based map navigation, alleviates problems related to GPS-spoofing and enables navigation in GPS-denied environments. Our system is tested in two scenarios using the Unreal Engine-based AirSim [32] plugin for drone simulation with promising results of average cross track distance less than 1.4 meters and mean waypoints minimum distance of less than 1 meter.},
